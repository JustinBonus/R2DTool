This example uses simulated ground motion time histories from the Lawrence Livermore National Lab. Due to size constraints, the time histories are not bundled with R2D, but they are available at https://berkeley.box.com/s/65113pqclc2j29ve9alita5kr7q2jnwc . After downloading the zip file, extract its contents to the SW4 folder under input_data.
