summary: |
  This example highlights the use of R2D for advanced response estimation leveraging information provided through a building inventory. A template script is provided that creates a building-specific cantilever and performs the response-history analysis to obtain EDPs and the hazard is generated using empirical ground motion records from the PEER NGA West2 database.
